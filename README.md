# Heap_Fragmentation-


Heap fragmentation happens when memory in the heap becomes inefficiently used or broken into small, non-contiguous free blocks over time. This can make it hard for the system to allocate large contiguous blocks of memory, even if thereâ€™s technically enough free memory overall.


Types of Heap Fragmentation:
1. External Fragmentation
Occurs when free memory is split into small chunks scattered throughout the heap.
Even if the total free memory is enough, a large allocation can fail because there's no single chunk big enough.


2. Internal Fragmentation
Happens when a block of memory is allocated, but not all of it is used.
The leftover unused space inside the allocated block is wasted.
This can occur due to alignment or block-size rounding.


Why Heap Fragmentation Happens:
Frequent allocation/deallocation of different-sized blocks.

Long-running programs that allocate and free memory in unpredictable patterns.

Lack of memory compaction (common in languages like C/C++ where memory isn't moved automatically).
